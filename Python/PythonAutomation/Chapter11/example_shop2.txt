Hello:

  Are there any offers in fridges? I'm looking to replace mine that is old. I live in a fifth floor and the lift is broken, would that be a problem? I'll be fine with paying an extra.
  I think you also have a furniture department, right? What are the prices for mattresses?

  Thanks a lot,
    Carrie

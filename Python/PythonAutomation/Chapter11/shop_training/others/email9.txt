Good morning:

I'm contacting you on behalf of the electrical company. There is going to be some works for the whole commercial area during May. We don't expect any interruption of the supply, but won't be able to guarantee it. Please contact us as soon as possible if you think this will call an inconvenience.

Thank you,
  The Electrical Company

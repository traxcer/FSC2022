Good morning,

  Are there any good fridges with double doors? I am changing the kitchen and was looking to get a bigger one. Ideally it should be a freezer in one and regular refrigerator in the other. And with an ice dispensator in front. If possible, in aluminum or chrome front.

  Thank you,
    Amanda
